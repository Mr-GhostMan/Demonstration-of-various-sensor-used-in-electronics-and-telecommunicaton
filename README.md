There is a need for demonstrating the use of various sensors and Website is the  best option as online learning is the Future of education as it makes easier and convenient. It is quite tedious to visit different pages each time to gather information about various sensors. Hence in this project we created a dynamic website which will Link the viewers to various datasheets and the user can gather information about various sensors under one website.
